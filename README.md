# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Python-ML-
Using logistic regression on credit card data, this project imports libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. The dataset is split, features are extracted, and a model is trained to detect fraud. Evaluation metrics and visualizations are used to assess and understand the model's performance.
